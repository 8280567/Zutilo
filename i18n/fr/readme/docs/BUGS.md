# Translation

New translations or improvements to existing translations are very welcome!
Zutilo has used (www.babelzilla.org) and (www.transifex.com) for translation services, but these sites are not kept up to date with the latest files due to lack of interest by translators.
If you would like to help with translation using one of these sites or another site, please get in touch!

When performning a translation, please translate all of the files in `chrome/locale/<locale_name>/zutilo` except `README.html` and all of the files in `Extra/locale/<locale_name>`.
For text files like `README.md`, please try put each sentence on a new line so that the translation file corresponds line by line with the English version.
