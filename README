Zutilo

Zutilo is a small Firefox extension that serves as a plugin for the Zotero Firefox extension.  Zutilo was designed as a utility to provide several small functionalities that are not present in Zotero.  Its name was chosen by taking the word "utility" and making it sound more like "Zotero."

Current feature list:

* Copy tags:
Right click items in the Zotero library and copy their tags to the clipboard as a '\r\n' delimited list.

* Copy creators:
Right click items in the Zotero library and copy their creators to the clipboard as a '\r\n' delimited list.

* View attachment paths:
Display the paths to attachments of selected items (one by one as separate dialog windows -- you probably don't want to select more than a couple items at a time this way!).

* Modify attachment paths:
Change the beginning of the path to all eligible attachments of selected items.  Two prompt windows appear.  The first asks for the old partial path while the second asks for the new partial path.  If you enter "C:/userData/references/" for the first path and "E:/" for the second path, then an attachment file with a path of "C:/userData/references/journals/Nature/2008/coolPaper.pdf" will have its path changed to "E:/journals/Nature/2008/coolPaper.pdf" while an attachment with path "E:/journals/Science/2010/neatPaper.pdf" will be left unchanged. This function is mainly useful for when you change computers or hard drives and break the links to all of your attachments.

* Relate items:
Set all selected items to be related to each other.

How to install:

If you have the zutilo.xpi file, go to Tools->Add-ons in Firefox and then click on the gear button and choose "Install Add-on From File." Then select the .xpi file.  (If you haven't downloaded anything yet, just download the .xpi file).

If you have the unzipped set of files (install.rdf, the chrome folder, etc.), you can zip them all, change the .zip extension to a .xpi extension and follow the directions above, or create a text file named zutilo@wesailatdawn.com, put the directory path to Zutilo's chrome folder as its only line of text, and save the file in the extensions folder of your Firefox profile folder.

Credits:

I started out by modifying the Zotero HelloWorld plugin.  I borrowed code from the Autocopy Firefox addon to make the functions that copy content to the clipboard.  I think everything else I got by looking through the Zotero source code.
