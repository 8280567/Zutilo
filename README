Zutilo

Zutilo is a small Firefox extension that serves as a plugin for the Zotero Firefox extension.  Zutilo was designed as a utility to provide several small functionalities that are not present in Zotero.  Its name was chosen by taking the word "utility" and making it sound more like "Zotero."

Current feature list:

* Right click items in the Zotero library and copy their tags to the clipboard as a '\r\n' delimited list.
* Right click items in the Zotero library and copy their authors to the clipboard as a '\r\n' delimited list.

How to install:

If you have the zutilo.xpi file, go to Tools->Add-ons in Firefox and then click on the gear button and choose "Install Add-on From File." Then select the .xpi file.  (If you haven't downloaded anything yet, just download the .xpi file).

If you have the unzipped set of files (install.rdf, the chrome folder, etc.), you can zip them all, change the .zip extension to a .xpi extension and follow the directions above, or create a text file named zutilo@wesailatdawn.com, put the directory path to Zutilo's chrome folder as its only line of text, and save the file in the extensions folder of your Firefox profile folder.
